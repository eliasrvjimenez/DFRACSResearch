Hi there! I will be using this README as the main way of Documenting my progress on this research

CURRENTLY PLANNED:

|      Project Name      |        Current Feature Planned            | Overall Progress| is Working|
|:----------------------:|:------------------------------------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|Twarc (Twitter Scraper) | Make a better query for scraping     |   100%  |  Yes |
|        MongoDB         | Mapping out Collected Data |   100%  | Yes |



## Twarc / Twitter Scaper

Currently using this from Twitter's API tutorial to scrape data from Twitter, I am only able to scrape about 7 day old tweets at the
moment, but I am able to get data from specific users.
 

## MongoDB

According to several people who use Twarc as their means of getting tweet data from twitter, using MongoDB to store scraped data is
the easiest way. after using it, I would have to say I agree. the easiest way to recieve twitter data from Twarc is in the form of 
a JSON file. MongoDB takes BSON Files, which is similar enough to JSON that MongoDB can just take the JSON files and turn it into
their file format.
